****Please let me know if you notice any mistakes or bugs!!!******

This code uses the MadgraphME package to calculate matrix elements and optimal observables for a given set of input data.

1. In the home directory, type the following to run the code:
	> rcSetup (uses version 2.4.14)
	> rc find_packages
	> rc compile
	> run any of the executables in the MatrixElement/util/ folder by typing in their name. 

2. The executables are:
	(a) addMEnew.cxx reads in a set of minitrees, calculates their matrix elements & optimal observables, plots them, and then copies
		the original minitrees and adds the ME and OO values to the tree.
	(b)	testME.cxx tests a given set of processes using randomly-generated four vectors, so you can quickly check if your ME code is working 



For more information on how to use the code ...

I. addMEnew.cxx
	1. 	List the files you want to test in FileNames (line 888)
	2. 	List the madgraph parameter cards in the corresponding card list; for example, if you are using a ggF process you will list the
		parameter cards under ggFCardNames (line 878). Right now, ggF 1 jet, VBF, and VH processes can be are implemented, but it is fairly simple to
		add more. Will be adding ggF 2 jet ASAP.
	3.  In the header (MatrixElement/MatrixElement/AddME.h), list the processes you will test. For example, if I want to test
		ggF 1 jet for e+,e-,e+,e-,g final state:
		
			#include "MadGraphME/CPPProcess_P0_Sigma_ggf_1jet_LO_HC_NLO_X0_UFO_heft_gg_epemepemg.h"	
			CPPProcess_P0_Sigma_ggf_1jet_LO_HC_NLO_X0_UFO_heft_gg_epemepemg *ggF1j_m_gg_epemepemg_SM;

		where ggF1j_m_gg_epemepemg_SM would be used in combination with a standard model parameter card (i.e.: one with everything equal
		to zero except for kSM and kHgg).
			
	4. 	In the main code, the processes are initialized at line 307. The names you use should be the same as the names listed in the 
		header file.
	5. 	Matrix elements are actually calculated at line 414 for the 2 jet case, and line 527 for the 1 jet case. 
	6.  VH and VBF use the same parameter cards, and also expect the fermions to be input in the same order (i.e.: see the name of the 
		MadGraphME file to know what order the fermion vector should have), so they are grouped together. They both use getFermionsVBFVH
		to sort the fermions (j1, j2, l1, l2, l3, l4).
	7.	ggF has a a different parameter card, and the 1 jet case has a different number of fermions, in a different order. getFermionsggF1j 
		sorts them as l1, l2, l3, l4, j1.
	8.	newT is the new tree with the extra branches for the ME and OO variables
	9. 	oldT is the old tree read in from the minitrees
		
Reading in multiple processes this way is a huge pain, so I will change the code to be more similar to testME.cxx, however, at the moment I could not get it 
to work with the minitrees.

II. testME.cxx
	List the parameter cards and corresponding processes at line 144. Fermion momenta are given random numbers, and the calculated ME is printed directly to terminal.
