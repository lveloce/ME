  /// @class MuJetOverlapTool
  /// @brief A tool implementing the recommended mu-jet overlap removal.
  ///
  /// This tool takes muons and jets and removes their overlaps based on
  /// various criteria including delta-R, jet track multiplicity, mu/jet PT
  /// ratio, JVT, and btagging results.
  ///
  /// The procedure works as follows.
  ///   1. Remove non-btagged jets that overlap with muons.
  ///        * Matching is done with ghost association or flat delta-R.
  ///        * Jets are then rejected if they have low track multiplicity or if
  ///          the muon has sufficient PT relative to the jet.
  ///   2. Remove muons from remaining non-pileup jets.
  ///        * Matching is done with either a flat delta-R or with the sliding
  ///          delta-R cone (c1 + c2/pt).
  ///
  /// To determine jet track multiplicity, the primary vertex is retrieved
  /// and used to query the NumTrkPt500 jet attribute.
  ///
  /// Some special configuration properties
  ///   UseSlidingDR     - activate sliding dR cone (c1 + c2/muPt)
  ///   SlidingDRC1      - c1 constant for sliding dR (default 0.04)
  ///   SlidingDRC2      - c2 constant for sliding dR (default 10GeV)
  ///   SlidingDRMaxCone - max cone size cutoff for sliding dR (default off)
  ///   NumJetTrk        - number of tracks required to give priorty to jet
  ///                      and remove the muon.
  ///
  /// @todo TODO document all the new propeties!
  ///
  /// These properties are useful for specifying PV-related quantities so that
  /// the tool doesn't need to retrieve the PV:
  ///   JetNumTrackDecoration   - user-defined numTrk decoration
  ///   JetSumTrackPTDecoration - user-defined sumTrkPt decoration
