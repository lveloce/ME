  /// \brief a modified tool handle that allows its owner to configure
  /// new tools from the C++ side
  ///
  /// One of the main differences between RootCore and Athena is that
  /// RootCore lacks a configuration manager.  This means that in
  /// RootCore we have to create and configure all tools on the spot,
  /// which is not (easily) possible in Athena.  This particular tool
  /// handle provides a dual-use way of doing so, while introducing a
  /// number of important safety pre-cautions that are lacking on the
  /// RootCore side.
  ///
  /// The primary (or at least original) purpose of this tool handle
  /// was to support dual-use analysis frameworks.  For these the
  /// actual configuration of the CP tools is a critical component,
  /// and having to configure them separately in RootCore and Athena
  /// is a potential source of rather difficult to track down bugs.
  /// An unfortunate side-effect of this is that we can't use the
  /// Athena configuration mechanism.  Once we have a dual-use
  /// configuration manager it will hopefully provide a more
  /// attractive option.
  ///
  /// A secondary benefit is that this allows to create and configure
  /// tools on the Athena side without having to write configuration
  /// files.  This is particularly beneficial when writing unit tests
  /// where you have to create a lot of rather short-lived tools and
  /// where separate configuration files would be impractical.  It may
  /// also be beneficial for new users who can (at first) be turned
  /// off by the complexity of Athena configuration.
  ///
  ///
  /// Conceptually this tools tries to model an std::unique_ptr or
  /// std::shared_ptr, for which calls to new, setProperty and
  /// initialize have been wrapped to make them dual-use as well as
  /// safer to use.  If a parent tool is specified, the tool is
  /// private (and this tool handle is modeled after unique_ptr).  If
  /// no parent tool is specified, the tool is public/shared (and this
  /// tool handle is modeled after shared_ptr).
  ///
  /// In public/shared mode, if you create and initialize one tool it
  /// is then available for use by other tool handles registered with
  /// the same name and type.  The subsequent tool handles with that
  /// name will then automatically pick up the tool in the
  /// configuration set by the first tool handle.  The user still has
  /// to call initialize() on the tool handle before using the tool.
  /// While it is allowed to call setProperty* method on those tool
  /// handles these calls will be effectively ignored.  The net effect
  /// of that is that as a user of a handle for a shared tool you
  /// don't have to worry about whether you are the one creating the
  /// tool or just using it, you just initialize the tool handle in
  /// the same way.
  ///
  /// The tool handle can also be declared as a property on the parent
  /// tool by using the ToolHandle provided via its handle member
  /// function.  This allows the user to override the configuration
  /// done in the parent tool via the job options file in Athena or
  /// via setProperty in RootCore.  Like for shared tools, initialize
  /// still has to be called and the calls to setProperty get ignored.
  /// This is so that inside the parent tool you don't have to write
  /// any special detection code to see whether the user configured
  /// the AnaToolHandle or if you need to do so yourself.  Instead,
  /// you can just write your code as if the user didn't configure
  /// your tool handle and if the user does, the tool handle will
  /// automatically switch over.
