  /// possible criteria:
  ///   1. The electrons share a track (on by default)
  ///   2. The electron clusters are overlapping (off by default)
  ///
  /// The rejected electron is decided as follows:
  ///   - author 'Ambiguous' rejected from author 'Electron'
  ///   - otherwise, the softer electron is rejected (in PT)
  ///
  /// The implementation here comes from discussions on JIRA issue ATLASG-438.
