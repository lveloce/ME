  /// @brief A tool implementing the recommended tau-jet overlap removal.
  ///
  /// This tool takes taus and jets and removes their overlaps based on
  /// delta-R and btagging results. In fact, currently the only difference
  /// between this implementation and the DeltaROverlapTool is that this tool
  /// will optionally give precedence to bjets over taus.
  ///
  /// The procedure works as follows.
  ///   1. Remove non-btagged jets that overlap with taus.
  /// That's it (for now).
