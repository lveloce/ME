 * @brief Interface for non-const operations on an auxiliary store.
 *
 * A @c DataVector may have auxiliary data associated with it.
 * These data are kept in separate AuxStore objects; this defines
 * the interface for non-const operations on such a store.
 * Const operations are defined by the base class
 * @c IConstAuxStore.
 *
 * An AuxStore may store a number of different aux data items;
 * these are identified by an integer of type @c auxid_t.
 * Each item is stored as a vector with one entry per entry
 * in the containing @c DataVector.
 *
 * This interface provides methods for getting a non-const pointer
 * to an existing vector of aux data items and for operations that
 * change the number of aux data items.
 * of existing aux data items.
